This application is our solution to a challenge project set by QA Academy Software Development course

The brief is as follows

> Project for 21/01/22
>
> You have been put in charge of running the database software for a trendy bar
>
> The client requires a backend to be produced using Java where they are able to do the following:
>
> - Add beers / foods / drinks to the database MySQL
> - Retrieve all items from a table from MySQL
> - Retrieve item by id / name
> - Update items
> - Delete items
>
> At minimum 1 table, stretch goal would be multiple tables NO NEED TO MAKE THEM RELATIONAL
>
> Your project should make use of the following:
> - SOLID Principles (as best as you can)
> - Generics
> - Optionals
> - Streams (returning data)
> - Exceptions (As well as creating some custom exceptions)
> - Attempt to use some of the design patterns, or make note of what design patterns you could use
>
> You should be able to access the methods using a runner
>
> Stretch goal - Use input scanners to allow the user to specify what they want to do
>
> MAKE A GITHUB REPO AND USE FBM:
> Main -> Dev -> Feature1
